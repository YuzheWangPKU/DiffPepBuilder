## Installation
We recommend using a conda environment to install the required packages. Please clone this repository and navigate to the root directory:
    
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YuzheWangPKU/DiffPepBuilder.git
cd DiffPepBuilder
```

Then run the following commands to create a new conda environment and install the required packages:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate diffpepbuilder
```

Before running *de novo* design protocols, please unzip the SSBLIB data in the `SSbuilder` directory:

```bash
cd SSbuilder
tar -xvf SSBLIB.tar.gz
```

The post-processing procedure requires [PyRosetta](https://www.pyrosetta.org/) to be installed. We recommend installing the pre-built wheel using the following commands:

```bash
wget https://west.rosettacommons.org/pyrosetta/release/release/PyRosetta4.MinSizeRel.python39.linux.wheel/pyrosetta-2024.39+release.59628fb-cp39-cp39-linux_x86_64.whl
pip install pyrosetta-2024.39+release.59628fb-cp39-cp39-linux_x86_64.whl
```

Please adjust the version or build to match your Python environment and system architecture.

## *De Novo* Design
To *de novo* generate peptide binders for a given target protein, please first download the model weights into `experiments/checkpoints/` from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/12794439). You can use the following command to download the model weights:

```bash
wget https://zenodo.org/records/12794439/files/diffpepbuilder_v1.pth
mv diffpepbuilder_v1.pth experiments/checkpoints/
```

We provide an example of the target ALK1 (Activin Receptor-like Kinase 1, PDB ID: [6SF1](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6SF1)) to demonstrate the procedures of generating peptide binders. Please note that the following pipeline can also be used to generate peptide binders for multiple targets simultaneously. The hotspots or binding motif of the target protein can be specified in JSON format, as showcased by the example file `examples/receptor_data/de_novo_cases.json`. To preprocess the receptor, run the `experiments/process_receptor.py` script:

```bash
python experiments/process_receptor.py --pdb_dir examples/receptor_data --write_dir data/receptor_data --receptor_info_path examples/receptor_data/de_novo_cases.json
```

This script will generate the receptor data in the `data/receptor_data` directory. To generate peptide binders for the target protein, please specify the root directory of DiffPepBuilder repository and then run the `experiments/run_inference.py` script (modify the `nproc-per-node` flag accordingly based on the number of GPUs available):

```bash
export BASE_PATH="your/path/to/DiffPepBuilder"
torchrun --nproc-per-node=8 experiments/run_inference.py data.val_csv_path=data/receptor_data/metadata_test.csv
```

The config file `config/inference.yaml` contains the hyperparameters for the inference process. Below is a brief explanation of the key hyperparameters:

| Parameter            | Description                                                                         | Default Value |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **use_ddp**          | Indicates whether Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) training is used                  | True          |
| **use_gpu**          | Specifies whether to use GPU for computation                                        | True          |
| **num_gpus**         | Number of GPUs to use for computation                                               | 8             |
| **num_t**            | Number of denoising steps                                                           | 200           |
| **noise_scale**      | Scaling factor for noise, analogous to sampling temperature                         | 1.0           |
| **samples_per_length** | Number of peptide backbone samples per sequence length                            | 8             |
| **min_length**       | Minimum sequence length to sample                                                   | 8             |
| **max_length**       | Maximum sequence length to sample                                                   | 30            |
| **seq_temperature**  | Sampling temperature of the residue types                                           | 0.1           |
| **build_ss_bond**    | Indicates whether to build disulfide bonds                                          | True          |
| **max_ss_bond**      | Maximum number of disulfide (SS) bonds to build                                     | 2             |

You can modify these hyperparameters to customize the inference process. For more details on the hyperparameters, please refer to our [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c00975).

After running the inference script, the generated peptide binders will be saved in the `runs/inference/`. To run the side chain reconstruction and optimization, please run the following script subsequently:

```bash
export BASE_PATH="your/path/to/DiffPepBuilder"
python experiments/run_postprocess.py --in_pdbs runs/inference --ori_pdbs examples/receptor_data --amber_relax --rosetta_relax
```

The script will generate the final peptide binders and calculate the binding ddG values of the generated peptide binders. The results will be summarized in the `runs/inference/postprocess_results.csv` file.

## Docking
To run peptide docking protocols for a given target protein, please first download the model weights into `experiments/checkpoints/` from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15398020). You can use the following command to download the model weights:

```bash
wget https://zenodo.org/records/15398020/files/diffpepdock_v1.pth
mv diffpepdock_v1.pth experiments/checkpoints/
```

DiffPepDock provides user-friendly, automated scripts for docking batches of peptide sequences to a specific target protein. Here we provide an example of the redocking task of the substrate-binding protein YejA in complex with its native peptide fragment (PDB ID: [7Z6F](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7Z6F)) to demonstrate the procedures of docking process. You may modify the file `examples/docking_data/peptide_seq.fasta` include custom peptide sequences for docking. Prior binding information including reference ligands and binding motifs can be specified in JSON format, as demonstrated in `examples/docking_data/docking_cases.json`, using the same syntax as in *de novo* design.

To preprocess the target and the peptide sequences, run the `experiments/process_batch_dock.py` script:

```bash
python experiments/process_batch_dock.py --pdb_dir examples/docking_data --write_dir data/docking_data --receptor_info_path examples/docking_data/docking_cases.json --peptide_seq_path examples/docking_data/peptide_seq.fasta
```

The preprocessed data will be placed in the `data/docking_data` directory. Redocking of existing protein–peptide complexes can be performed by omitting the `peptide_seq_path` argument and specify the peptide ligand chain in the `docking_cases.json` file.

To perform protein-peptide docking, please specify the root directory of DiffPepBuilder repository and then run the `experiments/run_docking.py` script (please modify the `nproc-per-node` flag accordingly based on the number of GPUs available):

```bash
export BASE_PATH="your/path/to/DiffPepBuilder"
torchrun --nproc-per-node=8 experiments/run_docking.py data.val_csv_path=data/docking_data/metadata_test.csv
```

The config file `config/docking.yaml` contains the hyperparameters for both the docking and postprocessing procedures. You can modify these hyperparameters to customize the overall workflow. Upon completion of the inference script, the generated protein-peptide complexes will be saved in the `runs/docking/` directory.

To improve efficiency, the automatic postprocessing step can be skipped by setting `postprocess.run_postprocess` to `False` in `config/docking.yaml`. Postprocessing can then be executed separately with improved parallelization using the following command:

```bash
export BASE_PATH="your/path/to/DiffPepBuilder"
python experiments/run_postprocess.py --in_pdbs runs/docking --ori_pdbs examples/docking_data --amber_relax --rosetta_relax
```

This script generates the final protein-peptide complexes and computes the binding ddG values as a pose scoring metric. The results are summarized in the `runs/docking/postprocess_results.csv` file.

## Training
To train the DiffPepBuilder model from scratch, please download the training data from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/13744959) and unzip the data in the `data/` directory:

```bash
wget https://zenodo.org/records/13744959/files/PepPC-F_raw_data.tar.gz
mkdir data/PepPC-F_raw_data
tar -xvf PepPC-F_raw_data.tar.gz --strip-components=1 -C data/PepPC-F_raw_data
```

To preprocess the training data, run the `experiments/process_dataset.py` script:

```bash
python experiments/process_dataset.py --pdb_dir data/PepPC-F_raw_data --write_dir data/complex_dataset
```

This script will generate the training data in the `data/complex_dataset` directory. You can add `max_batch_size` flag to specify the maximum batch size for ESM embedding to avoid out-of-memory errors. Then split the data into training and validation sets:

```bash
python experiments/split_dataset.py --input_path data/complex_dataset/metadata.csv --output_path data/complex_dataset --num_val 200
```

You can modify the `num_val` flag to specify the number of validation samples. To train the DiffPepBuilder model, please specify the root directory of the DiffPepBuilder repository and then run the `experiments/train.py` script (modify the `nproc-per-node` flag accordingly based on the number of GPUs available):

```bash
export BASE_PATH="your/path/to/DiffPepBuilder"
torchrun --nproc-per-node=8 experiments/train.py
```

The config file `config/base.yaml` contains the hyperparameters for the training process. You can modify these hyperparameters to customize the training process. Checkpoints will be saved every 10,000 steps after validation in the `runs/ckpt/` directory by default. Training logs will be saved every 2,500 steps. 

To run subsequent finetuning for docking tasks, please prepare the PepPC dataset, update the config file `config/finetune.yaml` accordingly, and run the following command:

```bash
export BASE_PATH="your/path/to/DiffPepBuilder"
torchrun --nproc-per-node=8 experiments/train.py --config-name=finetune
```
